Upload this code onto an Arduino Compatible microcontroller through
the Arduino IDE. Connect to master GND, VCC, SCL, SDA. Be sure to use 
pullup resistors on the I2C lines. View the master example to see how to 
communicate to your new I2C port expander. 

Be sure to make the slave id compatible with your master.
